        <h3>Bidriware</h3>
            <p>Bidriware is a traditional form of metalcraft originating from Bidar, Karnataka, but it is also practiced in Maharashtra. Known for its intricate inlay work, Bidriware involves creating metal objects, primarily from a combination of zinc and copper, and decorating them with silver inlays.

                The process begins with casting the base object in metal, followed by engraving designs and applying silver wire or sheets into the engraved patterns.

                Bidriware pieces often include items like vases, bowls, and boxes, and they are prized for their aesthetic beauty and durability. This craft reflects the rich tradition of metalwork in Maharashtra, blending artistry with functional design.</p>
