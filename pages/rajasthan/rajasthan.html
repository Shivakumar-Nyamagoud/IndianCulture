            <h2>FOOD</h2>
            <div class="cont2sub">
                <P class="food">Rajasthani cuisine is the traditional cuisine of the Rajasthan state in north-west India. It was influenced by various factors like the warlike lifestyles of its inhabitants, the availability of ingredients in an arid region and by Hindu temple traditions of sampradayas like Pushtimarg and Ramanandi. Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred.

                    Scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. Signature Rajasthani dishes include Dal Baati Churma, Panchratna Dal, Papad ro Saag, Ker Sangri, Gatte ro Saag. It is also known for its snacks like Bikaneri bhujia, Mirchi bada and Kanda kachauri. Other famous dishes include Dal Baati, malaidar special lassi (lassi) and Lashun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), Mawa lassi from Jodhpur, Alwar ka mawa, Malpauas from Pushkar and rasgulla from Bikaner, "paniya"and "gheriya" from Mewar.
                    
                    Originating for the Marwar region of the state is the concept Marwari Bhojnalaya, or vegetarian restaurants, today found in many parts of India, which offer vegetarian food of the Marwari people. The history also has its effect on the diet as the Rajputs preferred majorly a non-vegetarian diet while the Brahmins, Jains, Bishnois and others preferred a vegetarian diet. So, the state has a myriad of both types of delicacies.
                    
                    According to a 2014 survey released by the registrar general of India, Rajasthan has 74.9% vegetarians, which makes it the most vegetarian state in India.

                  <h3>Teej Festival</h3>
                  <p>Teej is celebrated on the third day of the waxing moon in the month of Shravan (Hindu calendar), and on the third day of the waning and waxing moons in the Hindu month of Bhadrapad. However, Rajasthan is not the only state Teej is celebrated in, many other states in the north and west India observe this monsoon festival held in August and September. Although, it is fair to say that Teej is celebrated with great zeal and enthusiasm in the desert state of Rajasthan. Ideally, there are three Teej festivals, namely, Haryali (Green) Teej, Kajari/Kajli Teej and Hartalika Teej.
                      According to Hindu mythology, after the self-immolation of Sati, Lord Shiva became grief-stricken and went into a meditative state. It is believed, it took Sati 108 subsequent births to bring Lord Shiva out of his meditative state. Her 108th birth was in the form of Parvati. Thus, married women seek the blessings of Goddess Parvati on Teej Festival for marital bliss.
                      On the occasion of Teej Festival, women observe a fast and pray through the night. In the morning, they bathe and dress in red sarees and fine jewellery to worship Goddess Parvati. The major attractions of Teej Festival are the swings that are fixed to the branches of large trees, on which the women take turns to enjoy swinging. Special songs are sung, and the women decorate their hands with henna. Married daughters are presented with sweets and clothes by their mothers. The girls engaged to be married receive gifts of henna, bangles, clothes, and sweets from the in-laws.</p>

                  <h3>Elephant Fair</h3>
                  <p>The Elephant Festival is a festival celebrated in the city of Jaipur in Rajasthan state in India. The Elephant Festival begins with a procession of bedecked elephants, camels, horses and folk dancers. The owners embellish their elephants with vibrant colours, jhool (saddle cloth) and heavy jewelry. Female elephants wear anklets that tinkle as they walk. People perched on top of elephants sprinkle gulaal (coloured powder). The most beautifully decorated elephant is awarded as the winner. Elephant polo, elephant racing, and a game of tug-of-war between elephants and 19 people are the featured events of the festival. The elephants are also outfitted with ear danglers and brocade scarves to embellish their ears and necks. The Mahouts, who are known as the caretakers of the elephants, decorate the foreheads of the animals with head-plates as well as garnish their tusks with gold, silver bracelets and rings. Other events that take place during the festival include a polo match and a tug of war contest, where the strongest elephant is chosen to compete against a group of ten people.
  
                      Although the festival is primarily based on elephants, other animals such as camels and horses also participate.

        <p>Blue pottery is a widely popular traditional craft from Jaipur, Rajasthan. Although, the art originally has a Turko-Persian background.
    
            The name ‘Blue Pottery’ comes from a vibrant cobalt blue dye colour that artists use for making articles.
            It is specifically a blue and white form of pottery, which is Euroasian in type. The size and shape of art take influences from Chinese pottery.
    
            While carving the port for this craft, there is no usage of no clay. Craftsmen use quartz stone powder, powdered glass, gum borax and Multani mitti (Fuller’s Earth) and water to make a dough for the port article.
            
            These pottery items are normally embellished with animals, birds and flower motifs. Handicrafts that are commonly made with pottery include a flower vase, ashtray, small bowls and ports.

        <h3>Puppet</h3>
            <p>A puppet is familiar in India as a kathputli. The name links back with two Rajasthani language words, Kath meaning wood and Putli, which means no life.
        
                Kathputli means a puppet, which is completely made with wood. An artist uses cotton and colourful clothes to make them look stunning.

                According to many historians, this art is a thousand years old. The tradition of Kathputli began with ancient folk tales about rich kings and kingdoms.</p>
