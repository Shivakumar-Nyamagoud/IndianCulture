            <h3>Kumbh Mela - The largest religious gathering in the world</h3>
            <p>Kumbh Mela is one of the largest and most spiritually significant religious gatherings in the world, held in Uttar Pradesh and other sacred locations in India. It takes place every 12 years at four rotating sites, with Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad) in Uttar Pradesh being one of the most important. The festival is centered around the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers, where millions of pilgrims gather to take a holy dip, believed to cleanse sins and grant liberation (moksha).</p>
            <p>Kumbh Mela is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology, with its origins tied to the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan) and the pursuit of the nectar of immortality. The event attracts saints, sadhus, and devotees from across the country, with grand processions, religious discourses, and rituals taking place. The gathering is a powerful display of India's religious devotion, spiritual unity, and cultural heritage.</p>
